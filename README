3D particulate flow simulation code.
------------------------------------

Before build:
-------------

 0. Copy the ves3d project files to the install location and make an
    environment variable pointing to that location:

    $ cd ves3d-cxx
    $ export VES3D_DIR=`pwd`

 1. In makefile.in.files directory, copy the makefile.in.sample file
    to makefile.in.<hostname>

    $ cd makefile.in.files
    $ cp makefile.in.sample makefile.in.<hostname>

 2. Make sure that the makefile corresponding to the host machine (the
    value returned by hostname in the shell) exists in the
    makefile.in.files/ or alternatively set the PLATFORM environmental
    variable or modify the PLATFORM in makefile.in.

 3. In the platform specific makefile, set the correct include paths
    for libraries

 4. If the makefile corresponding to your choice of compiler does
    not exist, you also need to write that makefile (with the correct
    extension)

 5. Make a symbolic link to makefile.in.<hostname>

    $ln -s makefile.in.<hostname> makefile.in

 6. Optionally add makefile.in.<hostname> to hg for future reference

Building:
---------

 1. cd to VES3D_DIR and

 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make check

 2. If the code compiles fine and tests pass, run

 $ make install


Misc:
-----
 . Code-specific compiler options are: VERBOSE, PROFILING,
 VES3D_TESTING, USE_GPU, USE_PVFMM

 . if you want the GPU code compiled set "USE_GPU=yes" in
 makefile.in.<hostname>

 . Fully functional revisions of code are tagged by vYY.ID (YY is year
 and ID is an integer)
