3D particulate flow simulation code.
------------------------------------

To build:
---------

 . In makefile.in.files directory, copy the makefile.in.sample file to
 makefile.in then
   
    1. Make sure that the makefile corresponding to the host machine
    (the value returned by hostname in the shell) exists in the
    makefile.in.files/ or alternatively set the PLATFORM enviromental
    variable or modify the PLATFORM in makefile.in.
    
    2. In the platform specific makefile, set the corret include paths
      for libraries
 
    3. If the makefile corresponding to your choice of compiler does
    not exist, you also need to write that makefile (with the correct
    extension)

 . call make at the VES3D_DIR directory
 . make a softlink to the directory precomputed/ in the test/ directory.
 . call "make check" in the test/

 . Code-specific compiler options are: VERBOSE, PROFILING, VES3D_TESTING

if you want the GPU code compiled set "USE_GPU=yes" in makefile.in
