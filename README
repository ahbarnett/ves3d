3D particulate flow simulation code.
------------------------------------

To build:
---------
 . set the appropritate platform in makefile.in.files/makefile.in and
make sure that the corresponding makefile.in.$(PLATFORM) exist.
 
 . if necessary modify makefile for CXX flags and BLAS paths
 . call make at the VES3D_DIR
 . make a softlink to the directory precomputed/ in the test/ directory.
 . call "make check" in the test/

 . Code-specific compiler options are: VERBOSE, and PROFILING

if you want the GPU code compiled set "USE_GPU=yes" in makefile.in
