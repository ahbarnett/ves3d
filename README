3D particulate flow simulation code.
------------------------------------

To build:
---------
 . make sure that the makefile corresponding to the host machine (the
 value returned by hostname in the shell) exists in the
 makefile.in.files/.
 
 . call make at the VES3D_DIR directory
 . make a softlink to the directory precomputed/ in the test/ directory.
 . call "make check" in the test/

 . Code-specific compiler options are: VERBOSE, and PROFILING

if you want the GPU code compiled set "USE_GPU=yes" in makefile.in
